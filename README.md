# Introduction

Plex Autoscan is a python script that assists in the importing of Sonarr, Radarr, and Lidarr downloads into Plex Media Server.

It does this by creating a web server to accept webhook requests from these apps, and in turn, sends a scan request to Plex. Plex will then only scan the parent folder (i.e. season folder for TV shows, movie folder for movies, and album folders for music) of the media file (versus scanning the entire library folder).

In addition to the above, Plex Autoscan can also monitor Google Drive for updates. When a new file is detected, it is checked against the Plex database and if this file is missing, a new scan request is sent to Plex (see section [below](README.md#google-drive-monitoring)).

Plex Autoscan is installed on the same server as the Plex Media Server.

# Requirements

1. Any OS that supports Python.

2. Python 2.7 or higher (`sudo apt install python python-pip`).

3. requirements.txt modules (see below).

# Installation

## Ubuntu/Debian

1. `cd /opt`

1. `sudo git clone https://github.com/l3uddz/plex_autoscan`

1. `sudo chown -R user:group plex_autoscan` - Run `id` to find your user / group.

1. `cd plex_autoscan`

1. `sudo python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. `python scan.py sections` - Run once to generate a default `config.json` file.

1. `/opt/plex_autoscan/config/config.json` - Configure settings (do this before moving on).

1. `sudo cp /opt/plex_autoscan/system/plex_autoscan.service /etc/systemd/system/`

1. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

1. `sudo systemctl enable plex_autoscan.service`

1. `sudo systemctl start plex_autoscan.service`

## Windows

_Note: It's recommended that you install Rclone and Python using chocolatey._

# Configuration

_Note: Changes to config file require a restart of the Plex Autoscan service (e.g. `sudo systemctl restart plex_autoscan.service` in Ubuntu)._

### Windows

_Note: Windows specific differences only shown. This assumes you mounted your rclone mount to G:\

```json
{
  "PLEX_DATABASE_PATH": "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Plex Media Server\\Plug-in Support\\Databases\\com.plexapp.plugins.library.db",
  "PLEX_SCANNER": "%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\Plex\\Plex Media Server\\Plex Media Scanner.exe",
  "PLEX_SUPPORT_DIR": "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Plex Media Server",
  "PLEX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Plex Media Server",
    "RCLONE": {
    "BINARY": "%ChocolateyInstall%\\bin\\rclone.exe",
    "CONFIG": "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\.config\\rclone\\rclone.conf",
    "RC_CACHE_REFRESH": {
      "FILE_EXISTS_TO_REMOTE_MAPPINGS": {
        "Media/": [
            "G:\\Media"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
   "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
    "G:\\media\\movies\\": [
      "/data/media/movies/"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Basics


```json
"USE_SUDO": true
```

`USE_SUDO` - This option is typically used in conjunction with `PLEX_USER` (e.g. `sudo -u plex`). Default is `true`.

  - The user that runs Plex Autoscan needs to be able to sudo without a password, otherwise it cannot execute the `PLEX_SCANNER` command as `plex`. If the user cannot sudo without password, set this option to `false`.

  - If the user that runs Plex Autoscan is able to run the `PLEX_SCANNER` command without sudo or is installed with the same user account (e.g. `plex`), you can you can set this to `false`.

## Docker

Docker specific options.


_Note: Some of the Docker examples used below are based on the image by [plexinc/pms-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/plexinc/pms-docker/), with `/config/` in the container path mapped to `/opt/plex/` on the host. Obvious differences are mentioned between PlexInc and LSIO images._

```json
"USE_DOCKER": true,
"DOCKER_NAME": "plex",
```

`USE_DOCKER` - Set to `true` when Plex is in a Docker container. Default is `false`.

`DOCKER_NAME` - Name of the Plex docker container. Default is `"plex"`.


## Plex Media Server

Plex Media Server options.


### Plex Basics

```json
"PLEX_USER": "plex",
"PLEX_TOKEN": "abcdefghijkl",
"PLEX_LOCAL_URL": "http://localhost:32400",
"PLEX_CHECK_BEFORE_SCAN": false,
"PLEX_WAIT_FOR_EXTERNAL_SCANNERS": true,
"PLEX_ANALYZE_TYPE": "basic",
"PLEX_ANALYZE_DIRECTORY": true,
"PLEX_FIX_MISMATCHED": false,
"PLEX_FIX_MISMATCHED_LANG": "en",
```

`PLEX_USER` - User account that Plex runs as. This only gets used when either `USE_SUDO` or `USE_DOCKER` is set to `true`.

  - Native Install: User account (on the host) that Plex runs as.

  - Docker Install: User account within the container. Depends on the Docker image being used.

    - [plexinc/pms-docker](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker): `"plex"`

    - [linuxserver/plex](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex): `"abc"`

  - Default is `"plex"`.

`PLEX_TOKEN` - Plex Access Token. This is used for checking Plex's status, emptying trash, or analyzing media.

  - Run the Plex Token script by [Werner Beroux](https://github.com/wernight): `/opt/plex_autoscan/scripts/plex_token.sh`.

    or

  - Visit https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436-Finding-an-authentication-token-X-Plex-Token

`PLEX_LOCAL_URL` - URL of the Plex Media Server. Can be localhost or http/https address.

  - Examples:

    - `"http://localhost:32400"` (native install; docker with port 32400 exposed)

    - `"https://plex.domain.com"` (custom domain with reverse proxy enabled)

`PLEX_CHECK_BEFORE_SCAN` - When set to `true`, check and wait for Plex to respond before processing a scan request. Default is `false`.

`PLEX_WAIT_FOR_EXTERNAL_SCANNERS` - When set to `true`, wait for other Plex Media Scanner processes to finish, before launching a new one.

  - For hosts running a single Plex Docker instance, this can be left as `true`.

  - For multiple Plex Docker instances on a host, set this as `false`.

`PLEX_ANALYZE_TYPE` - How Plex will analyze the media files that are scanned. Options are `off`, `basic`, `deep`. `off` will disable analyzing. Default is `basic`.

`PLEX_ANALYZE_DIRECTORY` - When set to `true`, Plex will analyze all the media files in the parent folder (e.g. movie folder, season folder) vs just the newly added file. Default is `true`.

`PLEX_FIX_MISMATCHED` - When set to `true`, Plex Autoscan will attempt to fix an incorrectly matched item in Plex.

  - Plex Autoscan will compare the TVDBID/TMDBID/IMDBID sent by Sonarr/Radarr with what Plex has matched with, and if this match is incorrect, it will autocorrect the match on the item (movie file or TV episode). If the incorrect match is a duplicate entry in Plex, it will auto split the original entry before correcting the match on the new item.

  - This only works when 1) requests come from Sonarr/Radarr, 2) season folders are being used, and 3) all movies and TV shows have their own unique paths.

  - Default is `false`.

`PLEX_FIX_MISMATCHED_LANG` - What language to use for TheTVDB agent in Plex. 
 
  - Default is `"en"`.

### Plex File Locations

_Note: Verify the settings below by running the Plex Section IDs command (see below)._


```json
"PLEX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib",
"PLEX_SCANNER": "/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\\ Media\\ Scanner",
"PLEX_SUPPORT_DIR": "/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application\\ Support",
"PLEX_DATABASE_PATH": "/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db",
```

`PLEX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

  - Native Install: `"/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib"`

  - Docker Install: Path within the container. Depends on the Docker image being used.

    - [plexinc/pms-docker](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker): `"/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib"`

    - [linuxserver/plex](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex): `"/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/lib"`

`PLEX_SCANNER` - Location of Plex Media Scanner binary.

  - Native Install: `"/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\\ Media\\ Scanner"`

  - Docker Install: Path within the container. Depends on the Docker image being used.

    - [plexinc/pms-docker](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker): `"/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\\ Media\\ Scanner"`

    - [linuxserver/plex](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex): `"/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex\\ Media\\ Scanner"`


`PLEX_SUPPORT_DIR` - Location of Plex "Application Support" path.

  - Native Install: `"/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application\\ Support"`

  - Docker Install: Path within the container. Depends on the Docker image being used.

    - [plexinc/pms-docker](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker): `"/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application\\ Support"`

    - [linuxserver/plex](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex): `"/config/Library/Application\\ Support"`

`PLEX_DATABASE_PATH` - Location of Plex library database.

  - Native Install: `"/var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db"`

  - Docker Install: If Plex Autoscan is running directly on the host, this will be the path on the host. If Plex Autoscan is running inside a Plex container (e.g. https://github.com/horjulf/docker-plex_autoscan), this will be a path within the container.


### Plex Section IDs

Running the following command, will return a list of Plex Library Names and their corresponding Section IDs (sorted by alphabetically Library Name):

```shell
python scan.py sections
```

This will be in the format of:

```
SECTION ID #: LIBRARY NAME
```

Sample output:

```
 2018-06-23 08:28:27,070 -     INFO -      PLEX [140425529542400]: Using Plex Scanner
  1: Movies
  2: TV
```

### Plex Emptying Trash

When media is upgraded by Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr, the previous files are then deleted. When Plex gets the scan request after the upgrade, the new media is added in to the library, but the previous media files would still be listed there but labeled as "unavailable".

To remedy this, a trash emptying command needs to be sent to Plex to get rid of these missing files from the library. The options below enable that to happen.


```json
"PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH": true,
"PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH_CONTROL_FILES": [
  "/mnt/unionfs/mounted.bin"
],
"PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH_MAX_FILES": 100,
"PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH_ZERO_DELETED": true,
```

`PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH` - When set to `true`, empty trash of a section after a scan.

`PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH_CONTROL_FILES` - Only empty trash when this file exists. Useful when media files, located elsewhere, is mounted on the Plex Server host. Can be left blank if not needed.

`PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH_MAX_FILES` - The maximum amount of missing files to remove from Plex at one emptying trash request. If there are more missing files than the number listed, the emptying trash request is aborted. This is particularly useful when externally mounted media temporarily dismounts and a ton of files go "missing" in Plex. Default is `100`.

`PLEX_EMPTY_TRASH_ZERO_DELETED` - When set to `true`, Plex Autoscan will always empty the trash on the scanned section, even if there are 0 missing files. If `false`, trash will only be emptied when the database returns more than 0 deleted items. Default is `false`.


## Plex Autoscan Server

### Basics

```json
"SERVER_IP": "0.0.0.0",
"SERVER_PASS": "9c4b81fe234e4d6eb9011cefe514d915",
"SERVER_PORT": 3468,
"SERVER_SCAN_DELAY": 180,
"SERVER_USE_SQLITE": true
```

`SERVER_IP` -  Server IP that Plex Autoscan will listen on. Default is `0.0.0.0`.

  - `0.0.0.0` - Allow remote access (e.g. Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr running on another/remote server).

  - `127.0.0.1` - Local access only.

`SERVER_PORT` - Port that Plex Autoscan will listen on.

`SERVER_PASS` - Plex Autoscan password. Used to authenticate requests from Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr. Default is a random 32 character string generated during config build.

  - Your webhook URL will look like: http://ipaddress:3468/server_pass (or http://localhost:3468/server_pass if local only).

`SERVER_SCAN_DELAY` - How long (in seconds) Plex Autoscan will wait before sending a scan request to Plex.

  - This is useful, for example, when you want Plex Autoscan to wait for more episodes of the same TV show to come in before scanning the season folder, resulting in less work for Plex to do by not scanning the same folder multiple times. This works especially well with `SERVER_USE_SQLITE` enabled.

`SERVER_USE_SQLITE` - Option to enable a database to store queue requests. Default is `true`.

- The benefits to using this are:

  1. Queue will be restored on Plex Autoscan restart, and

  2. Multiple requests to the same folder can be merged into a single folder scan.

- Example log:

  ```
  Already processing '/data/TV/TV-Anime/Persona 5 the Animation/Season 1/Persona 5 the Animation - s01e01 - I am thou, thou art I.mkv' from same folder, aborting adding an extra scan request to the queue.
  Scan request from Sonarr for '/data/TV/TV-Anime/Persona 5 the Animation/Season 1/Persona 5 the Animation - s01e01 - I am thou, thou art I.mkv', sleeping for 180 seconds...
  ```

  The `180` seconds in the example above are from the `SERVER_SCAN_DELAY`, if any more requests come in during this time, the scan request will be delayed by another `180` seconds.

### Server - Path Mappings

List of paths that will be remapped before being scanned by Plex.

This is particularly useful when receiving scan requests, from a remote Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr installation, that has different paths for the media.

#### Native Install

Format:
```
"SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
    "/path/on/local/plex/host/": [  <--- Plex Library path
        "/path/on/sonarr/host/"  <--- Sonarr root path
    ]
},
```

_Note: This format is used regardless of whether Sonarr is on the same server as Plex or not._

Example:

```json
"SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
    "/mnt/unionfs/": [
        "/home/seed/media/fused/"
    ]
},
```

#### Docker Install

Format:

```
"SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
    "/path/in/plex/container/": [  <--- Plex Library path
        "/path/from/sonarr/container/"  <--- Sonarr root path
    ]
},
```

Example:

```json
"SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
  "/data/Movies/": [
    "/movies/"
  ]
}
```



If the filepath that was reported to Plex Autoscan by Radarr was `/home/seed/media/fused/Movies/Die Hard/Die Hard.mkv` then the path that would be scanned by Plex would be `/mnt/unionfs/Movies/Die Hard/Die Hard.mkv`.


#### Multiple Paths

You can also have more than one folder paths pointing to a single one.

Example:

```json
"SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
  "/data/Movies/": [
    "/media/movies/",
    "/local/movies/"
  ]
}
```


### Server File Checks

After a `SERVER_SCAN_DELAY`, Plex Autoscan will check to see if file exists before sending a scan request to Plex.


```json
"SERVER_MAX_FILE_CHECKS": 10,
"SERVER_FILE_CHECK_DELAY": 60,
"SERVER_SCAN_FOLDER_ON_FILE_EXISTS_EXHAUSTION": false,
```

`SERVER_MAX_FILE_CHECKS` -  The number specifies how many times this check will occur, before giving up. If set to `0`, this check will not occur, and Plex Autoscan will simply send the scan request after the `SERVER_SCAN_DELAY`. Default is `10`.

`SERVER_FILE_CHECK_DELAY` - Delay in seconds between two file checks. Default is `60`.

`SERVER_SCAN_FOLDER_ON_FILE_EXISTS_EXHAUSTION` - Plex Autoscan will scan the media folder when the file exist checks (as set above) are exhausted. Default is `false`.

### Server File Exists - Path Mappings

List of paths that will be remapped before file exist checks are done.

This is particularly useful when using Docker, since the folder being scanned by the Plex container, may be different to the path on the host system running Plex Autoscan.


Format:
```json
"SERVER_FILE_EXIST_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
    "/actual/path/on/host/": [
        "/path/from/plex/container/"
    ]
},
```


Example:
```json
"SERVER_FILE_EXIST_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
    "/mnt/unionfs/media/": [
        "/data/"
    ]
},
```


You can leave this empty if it is not required:
```json
"SERVER_FILE_EXIST_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
},
```

### Misc

```json
"RUN_COMMAND_BEFORE_SCAN": "",
"RUN_COMMAND_AFTER_SCAN": "",
"SERVER_ALLOW_MANUAL_SCAN": false,
"SERVER_IGNORE_LIST": [
  "/.grab/",
  ".DS_Store",
  "Thumbs.db"
],
"SERVER_SCAN_PRIORITIES": {
  "1": [
    "/Movies/"
  ],
  "2": [
    "/TV/"
  ]
},
```


`RUN_COMMAND_BEFORE_SCAN` - If a command is supplied, it is executed before the Plex Media Scanner command.

`RUN_COMMAND_AFTER_SCAN` - If a command is supplied, it is executed after the Plex Media Scanner, Empty Trash and Analyze commands.

`SERVER_ALLOW_MANUAL_SCAN` - When enabled, allows GET requests to the webhook URL to allow manual scans on a specific filepath. Default is `false`.

  - All path mappings and section ID mappings, of the server, apply.

  - This is also a good way of testing your configuration, manually.

  - To send a manual scan, you can either:

    - Visit your webhook url in a browser (e.g. http://ipaddress:3468/0c1fa3c9867e48b1bb3aa055cb86), and fill in the path to scan.

      ![](https://i.imgur.com/KTrbShI.png)

      or

    - Initiate a scan via HTTP (e.g. curl):

      ```
      curl -d "eventType=Manual&filepath=/mnt/unionfs/Media/Movies/Shut In (2016)/Shut In (2016) - Bluray-1080p.x264.DTS-GECKOS.mkv" http://ipaddress:3468/0c1fa3c9867e48b1bb3aa055cb86`
      ```

`SERVER_IGNORE_LIST` - List of paths or filenames to ignore when a requests is sent to Plex Autoscan manually (see above). Case sensitive.

  - For example, `curl -d "eventType=Manual&filepath=/mnt/unionfs/Media/Movies/Thumbs.db" http://ipaddress:3468/0c1fa3c9867e48b1bb3aa055cb86` would be ignored if `Thumbs.db` was in the ignore list.


`SERVER_SCAN_PRIORITIES` - What paths are picked first when multiple scan requests are being processed.

  - Format:
    ```json
    "SERVER_SCAN_PRIORITIES": {
      "PRIORITY LEVEL#": [
        "/path/to/library/in/Plex"
      ],
    },
    ```

## Google Drive Monitoring

As mentioned earlier, Plex Autoscan can monitor Google Drive for changes. It does this by utilizing a proactive cache (vs building a cache from start to end).

Once a change is detected, the file will be checked against the Plex database to make sure this is not already there. If this match comes back negative, a scan request for the parent folder is added into the process queue, and if that parent folder is already in the process queue, the duplicate request will be ignored.

```json

  "ENABLED": false,
  "CLIENT_ID": "",
  "CLIENT_SECRET": "",

  },
  ```
---

To set this up:

1. Edit `config.json `file, to enable the Google Drive monitoring and fill in your Google Drive API Client ID and Secret.

    ```json
    "ENABLED": true,
    "CLIENT_ID": "yourclientid",
    "CLIENT_SECRET": "yourclientsecret",
    ```

1. Next, you will need to authorize Google Drive.

   ```shell
   scan.py authorize
   ```

1. Visit the link shown to get the authorization code and paste that in and hit `enter`.

    ```
    Visit https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&client_id=&access_type=offline and authorize against the account you wish to use
    Enter authorization code:
    ```
1. When access token retrieval is successful, you'll see this:

   ```
   2018-06-24 05:57:58,252 -     INFO -    GDRIVE [140007964366656]: Requesting access token for auth code '4/AAAfPHmX9H_kMkMasfdsdfE4r8ImXI_BddbLF-eoCOPsdfasdfHBBzffKto'
   2018-06-24 05:57:58,509 -     INFO -    GDRIVE [140007964366656]: Retrieved first access token!
   2018-06-24 05:57:58,511 -     INFO -  AUTOSCAN [140007964366656]: Access tokens were successfully retrieved!
   ```

   _Note: Message stating `Segmentation fault` at the end can be ignored._

1. You will now need to add in your Google Drive paths into `SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS`. This will tell Plex Autoscan to map Google Drive paths to their local counter part.

   i. Native install

      - Format:

        ```json
        "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
            "/path/on/local/host": [
                "/path/on/sonarr/host/",
                "path/on/google/drive/"
            ]
        },
        ```

        _Note 1: The Google Drive path does not start with a forward slash (` / `). Paths in My Drive will start with just `My Drive/`. and paths in a Google Teamdrive will start with `teamdrive_name/`._

        _Note 2: Foreign users of Google Drive might not see `My Drive` listed on their Google Drive. They can try using the `My Drive/...` path or see what the log shows and match it up to that. One example is `Mon\u00A0Drive/` for French users._

      - For example, if you store your files under My Drive's Media folder (`My Drive/Media/...`), the server path mappings will look like this:

        ```json
        "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
          "/mnt/unionfs/Media/Movies/": [
            "/home/seed/media/fused/"
            "My Drive/Media/Movies/"
          ],
        },
        ```

      - For example, if you store your files under a Google Teamdrive called "shared_movies" and within a Media folder (`shared_movies/Media/...`), the server path mappings will look like this:

        ```json
        "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
          "/mnt/unionfs/Media/Movies/": [
            "/home/seed/media/fused/"
            "shared_movies/Media/Movies/"
          ],
        },
        ```

   ii. Docker install

      - Format:

        ```json
        "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
            "/path/in/plex/container/": [
               "/path/from/sonarr/container/",
               "path/on/google/drive/"
            ]
        },
        ```

        _Note 1: The Google Drive path does not start with a forward slash (` / `). Paths in My Drive will start with just `My Drive/`. and paths in a Google Teamdrive will start with_ `teamdrive_name/`.

        _Note 2: Foreign users of Google Drive might not see `My Drive` listed on their Google Drive. They can try using the `My Drive/...` path or see what the log shows and match it up to that. One example is `Mon\u00A0Drive/` for French users._

      - For example, if you store your files under Google Drive's My Drive Media folder (`My Drive/Media/...`) AND run Plex in a docker container, the server path mappings will look like this:

        ```json
        "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
          "/data/Movies/": [
            "/movies/",
            "My Drive/Media/Movies/"
          ]
        }
        ```

      - For example, if you store your files under Google Drive's Teamdrive called "shared_movies" and within a Media folder (`shared_movies/Media/...`) AND run Plex in a docker container, the server path mappings will look like this:

        - Format:

          ```json
          "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
            "/data/Movies/": [
              "/movies/",
              "NAME_OF_TEAMDRIVE/Media/Movies/"
            ]
          }
          ```

        - Example:

          ```json
          "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
            "/data/Movies/": [
              "/movies/",
              "shared_movies/Media/Movies/"
            ]
          }
          ```

1. Rclone Crypt Support - If your mounted Google Drive is encrypted using Rclone Crypt, Plex Autoscan can also decode the filenames for processing changes. This includes drives/team drives entirely encrypted or just a subfolder i.e. in the below example only the encrypt subfolder is encrypted.

    1. Configure Rclone values. Example below:

        ```json
        "RCLONE": {
          "BINARY": "/usr/bin/rclone",
          "CONFIG": "/home/seed/.config/rclone/rclone.conf",
          "CRYPT_MAPPINGS": {
            "My Drive/encrypt/": [
               "gcrypt:"
            ]
          }
        },
        ```

    1. Disable mime type checking in your config file. This is not currently supported with Rclone Crypt Decoding. Rclone crypt encodes file paths and encrypts files causing Google Drive to reports all files in a crypt as '"mimeType": "application/octet-stream"'.

        `"MIME_TYPES": false`

    1. Add in your Rclone crypt paths on Google Drive into 'SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS'. This will tell Plex Autoscan to map Rclone crypt paths on Google Drive to their local counter part.				

          ```json
          "SERVER_PATH_MAPPINGS": {
            "/home/seed/media/": [
            "My Drive/encrypt/"
            ]
          },
          ```

1. Google Drive Monitoring is now setup.

## Rclone Remote Control

_Note: This if for Rclone mounts using the "cache" or "vfs" backends._

When `RC_CACHE_REFRESH` is enabled, if a file exist check fails (as set in `SERVER_FILE_EXIST_PATH_MAPPINGS`), Plex Autoscan will keep sending an Rclone cache/expire or vfs/refresh requests, for that file's parent folder, until the file check succeeds.

For example, if the file `/mnt/unionfs/Media/A Good Movie (2000)/A Good Movie.mkv` doesn't exist locally, then a clear cache request will be sent to the remote for `A Good Movie (2000)` folder, on the Rclone remote. But if a file exist checks fails again, it will move to the parent folder and try to clear that (eg `Media`), and keep doing this until a file check exists comes back positive or checks count reaches `SERVER_MAX_FILE_CHECKS`.

```json
"RCLONE": {
  "RC_CACHE_REFRESH": {
    "ENABLED": false,
    "FILE_EXISTS_TO_REMOTE_MAPPINGS": {
      "Media/": [
        "/mnt/unionfs/Media/"
      ]
    },
    "RC_URL": "http://localhost:5572"
  }
},
```

`ENABLED` - enable or disable cache clearing.

`FILE_EXISTS_TO_REMOTE_MAPPINGS` - maps local mount path to Rclone remote one. Used during file exists checks.

- Format:

  ```json
  "FILE_EXISTS_TO_REMOTE_MAPPINGS": {
    "folder_on_rclone_remote/": [
      "/path/to/locally/mounted/folder/"
    ]
  },
  ```




`RC_URL` - URL and Port Rclone RC is set to.
